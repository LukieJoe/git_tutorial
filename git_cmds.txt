## Run one time -- setup upstream

# check with git remote -v | grep SIGBlockchain

# Add the remote, call it "upstream":

git remote add upstream https://github.com/SIGBlockchain/Project.git

# Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches,
# such as upstream/master:

## Update your fork with SIGBlockchain

git fetch upstream

# Make sure that you're on your master branch:

git checkout master

# Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that
# aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that
# other branch:

# git rebase upstream/master

# ALT
# Preserve your commits

git merge upstream/master

git commit

# update your remote repo
# on github.com

git push origin master

## PULL

git pull

## PUSH

git push origin master

## Pull Request

git request-pull -p <target> <target_repo> <your_branch>

# save the SHA1 in $(update) and send that msg via mail (or your favorite method)

## Resolve Pull

git fetch origin $(update)
git commit -m 'fetched devel'

git merge origin/$(update)

## if merge fails edit the failing files to resolve the merge issue

git add .

git commit -m 'fixed merge comflict'

git push
